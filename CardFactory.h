// CardFactory will generate all cards, and so, we will explore the factory pattern. A factory
// ensures that there is only a single unit in the program that is responsible to create and delete
// cards. Other parts of the program will only use pointers to access the cards. Note that means, we
// will delete the copy constructor and assignment operator in Card.

        CardFactory();
        static CardFactory;
